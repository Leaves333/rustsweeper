# rustsweeper

a terminal minesweeper clone written in rust

## todo:
- [x] find out what libraries to use
- [x] display board to terminal
- [x] implement controls: moving (hjkl), flags, clear
- [x] implement game logic
- [x] build a nice ui

## nice optional features
- make it so you can't hit mines on the first clear
- different board sizes
- colors, bold, etc. -- make the ui pretty
- different game modes (knight's move, timed, etc.)
- design it to take command line args?
