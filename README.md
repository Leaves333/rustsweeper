# rustsweeper

(hopefully) a terminal minesweeper clone written in rust

## todo:
- [ ] find out what libraries to use
- [ ] display board to terminal
- [ ] implement controls: moving (hjkl), flags, clear
- [ ] implement game logic
- [ ] build a nice ui

## nice optional features
- different board sizes
- colors, bold, etc. -- make the ui pretty
- different game modes (knight's move, timed, etc.)
- design it to take command line args?
