# rustsweeper

a terminal minesweeper clone written in rust

![demo](https://github.com/Leaves333/rustsweeper/blob/main/sample_image.png)

## building from source

clone the repository and build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Leaves333/rustsweeper.git
cd rustsweeper
cargo run
```

## todo:
- [x] make it so you can't hit mines on the first clear
- [ ] different board sizes
- [x] colors, bold, etc. -- make the ui pretty
- [ ] different game modes (knight's move, timed, etc.)
- [ ] design it to take command line args
